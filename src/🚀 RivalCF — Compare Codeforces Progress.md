🚀 RivalCF — Compare Codeforces Progress With Your Friends

Live: https://rival-cf.vercel.app/

GitHub: https://github.com/MJ5aif/RivalCF

I built RivalCF, a fast and visual tool to compare which Codeforces problems multiple users have solved. Great for rivals, teams, and study groups.

⚡ Made entirely with GitHub Copilot — I didn't manually write a single line.
🧩 The project is inspired by my senior brother Abdullah Vai’s tool: https://cftracker2.netlify.app/ (problems are collected from there..)

His CF handle: ioweheralot
